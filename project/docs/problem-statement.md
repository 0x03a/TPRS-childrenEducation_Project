# Problem Statement

Children all over the world face several challenges when using online learning platforms, especially for language learning:

- **Network Issues:**  
  Many children live in areas with poor or unreliable internet connectivity, making it difficult to access online educational content smoothly. For example, children in Palestine often experience frequent network disruptions that impact their learning.

- **Storage Limitations:**  
  Devices used by children, especially in developing regions, often have limited storage capacity, restricting the amount of downloadable content.

- **Heavy Database Use:**  
  Large, complex databases and bulky applications can slow down platforms, causing delays and frustrating young learners.

- **Accessibility Barriers:**  
  Lack of offline access means learning is interrupted without internet, reducing consistency.

- **Performance Problems:**  
  Slow loading times and high latency hinder interactive features like quizzes and story animations, which are crucial for engagement.

Existing language learning platforms, including those based on the TPRS (Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling) method, are often paid, not optimized for these challenges, limiting their effectiveness for children in network-constrained or resource-limited environments.

These issues collectively reduce the effectiveness and accessibility of language learning platforms for children globally.
