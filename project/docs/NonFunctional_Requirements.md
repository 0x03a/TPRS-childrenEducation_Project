# Non-Functional Requirements 

These requirements define the **quality attributes, performance standards, and operational constraints** the platform must meet.

---

## 1. Performance and Speed

- **Optimized for Low Bandwidth**:  
  Compress images, videos, and audio files; implement adaptive quality streaming to maintain functionality in low-connectivity areas.

- **Low Latency**:  
  Ensure minimal delay in interactive features such as quizzes, animations, and lesson progression.

- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**:  
  Store copies of website files (like images, scripts, videos) on servers around the world so users get them from the closest location, making the site load faster everywhere.

- **Caching Mechanisms**:  
  Save frequently used files and data either in the userâ€™s browser or on the server so the platform loads faster and uses less internet data.

- **Load Balancing**:  
  Share user traffic across multiple servers so no single server gets overloaded, keeping the site fast and stable even during busy times.

---

## 2. Mobile Responsiveness

- **Cross-Device Support**:  
  Ensure seamless functionality across smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

- **Support for Older Devices**:  
  The platform should remain usable on low-end Android devices common in developing regions.

---

## 3. Offline Functionality

- **Resilient Offline Mode**:  
  Core learning activities should remain functional without internet connectivity, with progress stored locally for later synchronization.

---

## 4. Scalability

- **User Load Handling**:  
  The platform must accommodate thousands of simultaneous users without service disruption.

- **Content Growth**:  
  Adding new languages, lessons, or multimedia content should not degrade system performance.

---

## 5. Cross-Platform Compatibility

- **Browser Support**:  
  Fully functional on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

- **OS Compatibility**:  
  Operates on Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS without reduced functionality.

---

## 6. Security and Data Privacy

- **End-to-End Encryption**:  
  Protect all communications and stored data using industry-standard encryption (e.g., TLS for transit, AES for storage).

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
  Assign permissions based on user type (student, teacher, parent, admin) to minimize security risks.

---

## 7. Accessibility (WCAG 2.0 Compliance)

- **Screen Reader Support**:  
  Compatible with assistive software that audibly reads on-screen text and describes elements for visually impaired users.

- **High-Contrast Visuals**:  
  Use color schemes with strong contrast to enhance readability.

- **Keyboard Navigation**:  
  Allow full platform navigation via keyboard shortcuts.

- **Readable Fonts and Layout**:  
  Use clear typography and uncluttered layouts to improve usability.

- **Child-Friendly UI**:  
  Include large buttons, intuitive icons, and simple navigation paths.

---

## 8. Reliability and Availability

- **Uptime Target**:  
  Maintain at least 99.5% uptime excluding scheduled maintenance.

- **Backup & Disaster Recovery**:  
  Regularly back up user data and maintain recovery protocols for system failures.

---

## 9. Data Usage Optimization

- **Low Data Mode**:  
  Option to disable high-bandwidth elements like animations or high-resolution media.

- **Media Optimization**:  
  Implement lazy loading and progressive file delivery to reduce consumption.

---

## 10. Localization and Internationalization

- **Multi-Language Interface**:  
  Support for multiple languages, with correct formatting for dates, numbers, and text direction (e.g., right-to-left for Arabic).

- **Culturally Relevant Content**:  
  Adapt lesson content to align with local customs, names, and cultural contexts.
