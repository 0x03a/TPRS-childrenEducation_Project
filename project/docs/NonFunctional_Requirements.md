# Non-Functional Requirements 

These requirements define the **quality attributes, performance standards, and operational constraints** the platform must meet.

---

## 1. Performance and Speed

- **Optimized for Low Bandwidth**:  
  Compress images, videos, and audio files; implement adaptive quality streaming to maintain functionality in low-connectivity areas.

- **Low Latency**:  
  Ensure minimal delay in interactive features such as quizzes, animations, and lesson progression.

- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**:  
  Store copies of website files (like images, scripts, videos) on servers around the world so users get them from the closest location, making the site load faster everywhere.

- **Caching Mechanisms**:  
  Save frequently used files and data either in the user’s browser or on the server so the platform loads faster and uses less internet data.

- **Load Balancing**:  
  Share user traffic across multiple servers so no single server gets overloaded, keeping the site fast and stable even during busy times.

---

## 2. Mobile Responsiveness

- **Cross-Device Support**:  
  Ensure seamless functionality across smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

- **Support for Older Devices**:  
  The platform should remain usable on low-end Android devices common in developing regions.

---

## 3. Offline Functionality

- **Resilient Offline Mode**:  
  Core learning activities should remain functional without internet connectivity, with progress stored locally for later synchronization.

---

## 4. Scalability

- **User Load Handling**:  
  The platform must accommodate thousands of simultaneous users without service disruption.

- **Content Growth**:  
  Adding new languages, lessons, or multimedia content should not degrade system performance.

---

## 5. Cross-Platform Compatibility

- **Browser Support**:  
  Fully functional on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

- **OS Compatibility**:  
  Operates on Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS without reduced functionality.

---

## 6. Security and Data Privacy

- **End-to-End Encryption**:  
  Protect all communications and stored data using industry-standard encryption.
  Use TLS (Transport Layer Security) to protect data while it’s being sent over the internet (in transit). 
  Use AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) to protect data when it’s saved on disks or databases (at rest).

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
  Give different users different levels of access depending on their role (like Author, Reviewer, Parent, Admin) to keep the system secure and limit what each person can do.
---

## 7. Accessibility (WCAG 2.0 Compliance)

The purpose of WCAG 2.0 (**Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.0**) Compliance is to make sure that everyone, including people with disabilities, can easily use and understand your website or app.

- **Screen Reader Support**:  
  Compatible with assistive software that audibly reads on-screen text and describes elements for visually impaired users.

- **High-Contrast Visuals**:  
  Use color schemes with strong contrast to enhance readability.

- **Keyboard Navigation**:  
  Allow full platform navigation via keyboard shortcuts.

- **Readable Fonts and Layout**:  
  Use clear typography and uncluttered layouts to improve usability.

- **Child-Friendly UI**:  
  Include large buttons, intuitive icons, and simple navigation paths.

---

## 8. Reliability and Availability

- **Uptime Target**:  
  Maintain at least 99.5% uptime excluding scheduled maintenance.

- **Backup & Disaster Recovery**:  
  Regularly back up user data and maintain recovery protocols for system failures.

---

## 9. Data Usage Optimization

- **Low Data Mode**:  
  Option to disable high-bandwidth elements like animations or high-resolution media.

- **Media Optimization**:  
  Implement lazy loading and progressive file delivery to reduce consumption.

---

## 10. Localization and Internationalization

- **Multi-Language Interface**:  
  Support for multiple languages, with correct formatting for dates, numbers, and text direction (e.g., right-to-left for Arabic).
  
## 11. Module Isolation

- **Independent Server per Module**:  
  Each major module of the platform will be deployed on a separate server or isolated service environment.  
  This ensures:
    - No single point of failure for all modules.
    - Scalability: Modules can be scaled independently based on usage.
    - Maintenance Flexibility: Updates or fixes to one module do not require downtime for the others.
    - Fault Containment: If one module encounters issues, other modules remain operational.

- **Example**:  
  - **Story Generation Module** — Runs on its own server.
  - **User Management Module** — Separate service.
  - **Quiz/Practice Module** — Isolated from other modules.
  - **Offline Sync Module** — Dedicated service for caching and synchronization.
